While based in the U.S., NASDAQ has a global impact, attracting listings and investors from around the world. It is associated with key stock market indices like the NASDAQ Composite Index, which includes a broad range of listed companies, and the NASDAQ-100 Index, focusing on major non-financial companies.
NASDAQ is known for hosting significant Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), especially in the technology sector, contributing to its reputation for innovation and growth-oriented companies. It plays a crucial role in global financial markets, embodying the modern, electronically driven landscape of securities trading.

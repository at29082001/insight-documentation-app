The dataset INDICATORS OF ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION contains information related to mental health indicators. The dataset seems to include both categorical data 
(e.g., gender identities, ethnicities) and numerical data (e.g., counts, percentages). Columns like LOW CI, HIGH CI and CONFIDENCE INTERVAL indicate that the dataset might 
include statistical information, possibly confidence intervals associated with reported values.

**Demographic Analysis**: 
The view appears to contain demographic statistics, which could be valuable for businesses or organizations interested in analyzing and understanding the composition of populations based on various characteristics.  

**Healthcare Planning**: 
If the indicators are related to mental health or well-being, the view might be used in the healthcare sector for planning and resource allocation. 

**Government Reporting**: 
The inclusion of state and federal government-related columns suggests that the view may be used for reporting to government agencies, compliance, or public health assessments.  

**Trend Analysis**: 
The time-related columns (TIME_PERIOD, TIME_PERIOD_START_DATE, TIME_PERIOD_END_DATE) suggest the potential for trend analysis over specific periods, helping businesses identify patterns and changes.  

**Public Policy Decision-Making**: 
Demographic and health-related data can be crucial for informing public policies, especially in areas related to mental health, well-being, and healthcare. 

**Resource Allocation**: 
Understanding demographic and health-related indicators by state and subgroup can assist in the allocation of resources, especially in regions with specific needs. 

**Performance Monitoring**: 
Organizations may use the view to monitor the performance of interventions, programs, or policies aimed at improving mental health or related outcomes. 

**Comparative Analysis**: 
Businesses or government agencies may use the view to compare demographic and health indicators across different states, subgroups, or time periods. 

**Decision Support**: 
Stakeholders in health-related organizations may use this view to support decision-making processes, whether in program planning or policy development.

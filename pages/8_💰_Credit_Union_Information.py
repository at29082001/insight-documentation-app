Established by the U.S. Congress in 1970, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is an autonomous federal agency responsible for safeguarding member deposits in federally insured credit unions. It provides deposit insurance, protecting the financial interests of credit union members. Additionally, the NCUA oversees and regulates federal credit unions, ensuring their compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Through its chartering process, the NCUA grants authorization for credit unions to operate, facilitating their establishment and growth. Overall, the NCUA plays a crucial role in promoting stability, consumer protection, and sound governance within the credit union industry. 
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) provides several key features and information to credit unions, credit union members, and the general public.
